# JARVIS
A PySimpleGUI application which can execute specific hardcoded commands. It is only to be used as a demo for speech-to-text and text-to-speech demo application.

## History
It was my first ever _proper_ Python project. Original version was made with the help of tutorial form [CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry). But the (comparatively) newer version is made using PySimpleGUI but the same speaking and listening logic. Although the project was originally made probably in late 2020, this Git repository was initialized today (04-07-2023 ~5:20 pm).
